I make a folder called turtulbot in Documents
Then I make it a workspace for my packages 

inside src folder I create a package called robot_tutorials and inside it I create a scripts folder to put my python files inside it 

in my case the files are talker.py (Publisher) and listener.py (Subscriber)
